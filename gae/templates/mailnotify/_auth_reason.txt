We could not access your mailbox due to an authentication failure.
You have probably uninstalled the chrome extension or revolked access
to your mailbox in your google account settings.

To solve this issue, make sure you have the chrome extension installed
and visit gmail.com to re-grant access.
If you are getting this error with the extension installed and
access granted, your domain administrator does probably not allow IMAP
access from SndLatr.
