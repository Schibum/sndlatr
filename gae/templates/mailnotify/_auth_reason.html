<p>
    We could not access your mailbox due to an authentication failure. <br>
    You have probably uninstalled the chrome extension or revolked access
    to your mailbox in your Google Accounts settings.
</p>
<p>To solve this issue, make sure you have the chrome extension installed
    and visit gmail.com to re-grant access.<br>
    If you are getting this error with the extension installed and
    access granted, your domain administrator does probably not allow IMAP
    access from SndLatr.
