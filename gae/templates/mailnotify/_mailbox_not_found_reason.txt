We could not access a mailbox that SndLatr requires to work properly.
SendLatr requires access to the special GMail mailboxes "All Mail" and "Trash"
via IMAP.

To solve this issue, please open Settings -> Labels in GMail
(https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labels)
and make sure "Show in IMAP" is checked for "All Mail" and "Trash".

If you have intentionally hidden these folders from IMAP to prevent
other IMAP clients from synchronizing, unsubscribe from these folders in your
IMAP clients instead.
